    <string name="bio">
        I\'m passionate about web, android, programming and tech generally. I also love and contribute
        to open source projects when I can.
        \n
        I work on personal projects such as Radaroid (android client for radar.techcabal.com), Peedgin
        (online dictionary for Pidgin english), WAEC (Unofficial API for WASSCE results), etc which I
        sometimes put on my Github.
        \n
        \t I am part of the KDE project where I contribute code/documentation to KDEConnect, a tool that
        helps sync media, uris, files, sms and notifications between Android phones and
        Linux desktop. I am also a volunteer Firefox advocate to help spread the Firefox gospel.
